# Nginx HTTP/3 Docker Image Builder

This project contains a Dockerfile that builds a custom nginx Docker image with HTTP/3 support, along with a comprehensive test environment.

## Features

- Builds nginx version 1.26.1 (configurable via ENV variable)
- Includes HTTP/3 (QUIC) support
- Uses BoringSSL (Google's SSL library with native QUIC support)
- Includes common modules like SSL, HTTP/2, and streaming
- Optimized for a minimal, production-ready image
- Includes a test environment with:
  - Go service for testing HTTP functionalities
  - WebSocket support
  - File upload/download capabilities
  - Traffic analysis tools

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose V2 (for test environment)
- SSL certificates (for HTTPS/HTTP3 testing)

## Usage

### Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t nginx-http3 .
```

### Run the container

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name nginx-http3-server \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -p 443:443/udp \
  -v /path/to/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro \
  -v /path/to/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro \
  -v /path/to/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:ro \
  nginx-http3
```

### Verify the container

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps

# Check nginx version and configuration
docker exec nginx-http3-server nginx -v
docker exec nginx-http3-server nginx -t
```

## Test Environment

The project includes a comprehensive test environment located in the `test/` directory. To use it:

1. Navigate to the test directory:
   ```bash
   cd test
   ```

2. Start the test environment:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the test services:
   - HTTP: http://localhost
   - HTTPS/HTTP3: https://localhost
   - WebSocket test page: http://localhost/ws-test

For detailed information about the test environment, including available endpoints and traffic analysis, see [test/README.md](test/README.md).

## HTTP/3 Configuration

To enable HTTP/3 support in nginx, you need to properly configure your server blocks. HTTP/3 requires HTTPS and QUIC protocol support. Here's the correct configuration:

```nginx
server {
    # Standard HTTP port - redirect to HTTPS
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    # Configure HTTP/3
    listen 443 ssl;                # Standard HTTPS
    listen 443 quic reuseport;     # UDP port for QUIC+HTTP/3
    server_name example.com;
    
    # SSL certificates
    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/certs/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/live/example.com/privkey.pem;
    
    # Enable HTTP/3
    http3 on;
    
    # Add Alt-Svc header to inform clients about HTTP/3 support
    add_header Alt-Svc 'h3=":443"; ma=86400';
    
    # SSL settings
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;         # TLSv1.3 preferred for HTTP/3
    
    # Your server configuration
    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

Key points to understand:

1. **Dual Listening**:
   - Standard TLS over TCP: `listen 443 ssl;`
   - QUIC+HTTP/3 over UDP: `listen 443 quic reuseport;`

2. **HTTP/3 Enabling**:
   - Use the directive `http3 on;` to enable HTTP/3 protocol

3. **Alt-Svc Header**:
   - The `Alt-Svc` header tells clients the server supports HTTP/3
   - The value `h3=":443"; ma=86400` means HTTP/3 is available on port 443 with a max age of 1 day

4. **TLSv1.3 Recommendation**:
   - HTTP/3 works best with TLSv1.3 for optimal performance

5. **UDP Port Requirements**:
   - Make sure port 443/UDP is open in your firewall for HTTP/3 to work
   
6. **Reuseport Option**:
   - The `reuseport` parameter allows multiple worker processes to accept connections from the same port
   - This improves performance in multi-worker nginx setups by distributing connection load

Note: HTTP/3 is still evolving, and this configuration is based on the current implementation in nginx 1.26.1 with HTTP/3 support.

## Customization

You can modify the Dockerfile to:

1. Change the nginx version by updating the `NGINX_VERSION` environment variable
2. Add or remove compile options in the `./configure` step
3. Include additional dependencies or modules
4. Modify build optimization flags

## Testing HTTP/3 Support

To verify HTTP/3 support:

1. Use curl with HTTP/3 support:
   ```bash
   curl --http3 https://localhost/api/
   ```

2. Check the Alt-Svc header in responses:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://localhost/api/
   ```

3. Use Chrome or Edge browser to test HTTP/3 connections (they support HTTP/3 by default)
